              <h2>Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi</h2>  
      </div>
      <div class="mt-1"> 
              <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi is the 15th Prime Minister of India and assumed office in May 2014. He was re-elected in the 17th Lok Sabha from Varanasi and led the Bhartiya Janata Party to a massive victory for a second term during 2019 Lok Sabha elections Before his role as the prime minister, he served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. He has been an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the past. Since coming to power, Modi has single-handedly made BJP the most powerful party in the country with power in most of the state. On July 20, he survived a no-confidence motion brought against his government by the TDP with a thumping margin. Narendra Modi is one of the most followed names on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Modi's rise in the BJP has been phenomenal. Ensuring three consecutive election victories for the party in Gujarat, Modi launched himself on to the national stage. Despite stiff opposition from party patriarch LK Advani, Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate for Lok Sabha elections in 2014. However, his elevation for the top post exposed internal difference in the party. Riding on his wave, the BJP decimated the Congress-led UPA in 2014.</p>

      <p>Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]

        Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[d] or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.[e] While his policies as chief ministerâ€”credited with encouraging economic growthâ€”have received praise, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f]
        
        Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. Modi centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings.[12][13][14]
        
        Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[15][16][g] Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread protests and sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the latter. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.</p>
